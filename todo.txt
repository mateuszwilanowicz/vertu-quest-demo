
General:
- there could be an intro animation / video before the globe.
- The Globe is the "Experience the phone" section, this is also the home page
- make html fullscreen, footer snaps to bottom at all time. 

Video Module:
- Need to add cuepoint / caption support
- Cuepoint data can be text/ images.
- Videos needs to play "Fullscreen"

Globe:
- stop planes callapsing into the phone
- stop planes from flipping
- change planes/thumbnails to 16:9 ratio
- take out flip effect
- Need history state on planes
- mouse active globe spin needs to accelerate faster
- mouse active globe mouseX coordinate needs to change according to fullscreen resize
- mouse active globe only needs to work on mouseX horizontal direction
- add xml settings for planes x,y,z etc... for designing and testing purpose
- add "experience site" rollover shimmer effect to planes


Where to buy:
- rollover drop down bug
- add arrow keys navigation on dropdowns, plus mousewheel support
- deeplinked where to buy should open with the 2D worldmap already opened. (skip the 3D transition)








Hand over note:

- Mateusz, in ModuleController.as there is a event handler called "stageResizedHandler" this is where
I am resizing the module at the moment. But as discussed this will need to be applied for all objects 
apart from controls etc.
